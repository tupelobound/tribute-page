freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design project - Build a Tribute Page

This was one of my first attempts at making a responsive webpage using HTML and CSS, and using Bootstrap.

I made this back in November 2017, and it is a tribute to Richey Edwards, one of the founder members of one of my favourite bands, Manic Street Preachers.
