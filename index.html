      <h5 id="intro">Considered by many to be the main influence behind Manic Street Preachers' early look and
        direction,
        Richey Edwards was an integral member of the band until his disappearance in 1995. Co-writing with bassist Nicky
        Wire, they were responsible for the intelligent, poetic, often political lyrics that the band are famous for.
        Richey was highly influential in the overall aesthetic of the band, designing record sleeves and artwork. Always
        open about his battle with depression, he was one of the first rock musicians in the UK to shine a spotlight on
        issues surrounding mental health. Throughout 1994, his behaviour became increasingly self-destructive until,
        ultimately, he went missing on the 1st February 1995. Below are some significant dates in his life, and in the
        career of the band.</h5>

          <li><strong>1988</strong> - Initially just being involved creatively behind the scenes and driving the band to
            gigs, Richey joins his friends to complete the line-up of Manic Street Preachers shortly after the release
            of
            the band's debut single 'Suicide Alley'. Soon becomes accepted as the band's spokesperson, and along with

            into
            his forearm following an argument with NME journalist Steve Lamacq, who had questioned the band's punk
            authenticity</li>
          <li><strong>10th February 1992</strong> - The Manics release their debut album 'Generation Terrorists'. The
            album cover features Richey's chest and left arm, sporting his 'Useless Generation' tattoo, with the words

          <li><strong>21st June 1993</strong> - 'Gold Against the Soul', the band's second album is released</li>
          <li><strong>29th August 1994</strong> - Manic Street Preachers release 'The Holy Bible', their third
            full-length
            album</li>
          <li><strong>July-August 1994</strong> - Misses several Manic Street Preachers festival appearances after
            checking himself into the Priory Hospital in an attempt to overcome his personal difficulties, which by this

          <li><strong>21st December 1994</strong> - Plays his final show with Manic Street Preachers at the London

            tour with James Dean Bradfield and is never seen by any of his friends or family again</li>
          <li><strong>17th February 1995</strong> - Richey's abandoned car is found at the Severn View service station.
            The service station's proximity to the Severn Bridge leads many people to believe that he took his own life
            by jumping from the bridge. No body, or other evidence that he killed himself has ever been found.</li>
